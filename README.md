Notification Demo

Notification Demo is a browser-based website that demonstrates how web notifications behave across different browsers and permission states. It includes a simulated “fake hacked” scenario designed purely for visual and educational purposes.

The project is intended for testing, learning, and showcasing UI behavior — not for real security alerts or malicious use.
